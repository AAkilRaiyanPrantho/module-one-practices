        <p>I'm not sure when my first encounter with my extreme explorer personality was, but I do know that it was very early on. Even when I was just 4 or 5 years old I was climbing trees and learning what it means to explore. I loved it, and I dragged my cousin around with me to explore as well. Although, he was not just as excited as me we still thought it fun to play tackle football in the backyard. After about 5 to 6 years of that we took a family trip to California in the summer after fourth grade. I was honestly just excited to fly and get to go all the way to other side of the country. The first couple days were fun, we went to San Francisco and Monterey so they were both city days. However, the last days was spent in Yosemite National Park, where we hiked up and down the mountain across waterfalls and I don't think a smile ever left my face. We ran into many different and interesting types of wildlife that added even more to the trip. I was always in the front going fast and strong, the whole way, I had to be the first to see everything or else it wouldn’t be the same. This was my first major hiking trip I had taken, and it got me hooked for life. Now I go on a hiking trip almost every spring and fall with my cousins and poppop, and every time whether it’s a one mile incline or it’s pouring rain, I am still having the time of my life.</p>
